# 🌐 Secure Your AKS App with HTTPS Using Ingress + TLS

To access your AKS-hosted app via browser using HTTPS, you’ll need to expose it to the internet securely.  
Your current configuration uses a `ClusterIP` service, which is **internal-only** — not accessible from outside the cluster.

This guide will walk you through exposing your app **securely with HTTPS** using **Ingress + TLS (SSL)** on **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**.

---

## ✅ Step 1: Update Your Service to Use `ClusterIP` (Already Done)

You're using:

```yaml
type: ClusterIP


This is correct for using Ingress, which will route traffic from a public IP to this internal service.

✅ Step 2: Install an Ingress Controller (NGINX)

You need an Ingress controller to handle external traffic. The most common is NGINX.

Run this on your machine (where kubectl is configured for your AKS cluster):

kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.9.5/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml


This will install the NGINX Ingress controller in your cluster.

✅ Step 3: Get the Ingress Controller’s Public IP

Wait for the LoadBalancer IP to be assigned:

kubectl get services -n ingress-nginx


Look for a service named ingress-nginx-controller, and copy its EXTERNAL-IP.

You’ll use this in your DNS later (e.g., point your domain to it).

✅ Step 4: Create a DNS Name (Optional but Recommended)

If you have a domain (like example.com), create a DNS A record pointing to the Ingress Controller’s External IP.

✅ For Testing, Use nip.io or sslip.io

They resolve automatically using the IP.

Example:

myapp.20.40.60.80.nip.io


Replace 20.40.60.80 with your Ingress External IP.

✅ Step 5: Deploy a TLS Certificate Using Cert-Manager + Let's Encrypt
1️⃣ Install Cert-Manager:
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/latest/download/cert-manager.yaml


Wait until cert-manager pods are ready:

kubectl get pods --namespace cert-manager

2️⃣ Create a ClusterIssuer for Let’s Encrypt:

letsencrypt-prod.yaml

apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-prod
spec:
  acme:
    email: your-email@example.com
    server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: letsencrypt-prod
    solvers:
    - http01:
        ingress:
          class: nginx


Apply it:

kubectl apply -f letsencrypt-prod.yaml

✅ Step 6: Create the Ingress Resource with TLS

ingress.yaml

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: natureapp-ingress
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-prod
spec:
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - myapp.20.40.60.80.nip.io  # Replace with your domain or DNS name
    secretName: natureapp-tls
  rules:
  - host: myapp.20.40.60.80.nip.io  # Replace with your domain
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: natureapp-service
            port:
              number: 80


Apply the Ingress:

kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml

✅ Step 7: Wait for HTTPS Certificate to be Issued

Check certificate status:

kubectl describe certificate natureapp-tls


Once the certificate is Ready, you can access your app via:

https://myapp.20.40.60.80.nip.io

✅ Bonus: Monitor Everything

Check Ingress health:

kubectl get ingress


Check NGINX logs:

kubectl logs -n ingress-nginx deploy/ingress-nginx-controller

🚀 Summary
Step	Description
✅ 1	Use ClusterIP service
✅ 2	Install NGINX Ingress Controller
✅ 3	Get External IP for Ingress
✅ 4	Use a domain (real or .nip.io)
✅ 5	Install cert-manager and create ClusterIssuer
✅ 6	Deploy Ingress with TLS config
✅ 7	Access your app via HTTPS

💡 You now have a secure, HTTPS-enabled, AKS-deployed app accessible from anywhere!
